	<h1>Tyreek Williams</h1>

	<p>My name is Tyreek Williams and I would describe myself as being a chill and relaxed person who tends to go with the flow of things. I am friendly and I like to interact with other people. I consider myself to be an independent person because when there is something that I am interested in or would like to learn more aboubt, I go out and learn about it on my own.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Take more initiative</li>
		<li>Study more</li>
	</ul>
